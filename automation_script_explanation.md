# Career Growth Plan - 16 Weeks Overview

## Explanation
The script writes the full 16-week plan to a CSV file named `career_growth_plan_16_weeks.csv`. Each week focuses on a specific topic, and the tasks are organized day by day within the CSV.

### Features:
- **Cheat Days**: Days where no task is performed are automatically skipped.
- **CSV Structure**: The generated CSV file contains the following columns:
  - **Subject**: The topic for the week.
  - **Start Date**: The date when the week begins.
  - **Start Time**: The time when tasks start.
  - **Duration (Minutes)**: The estimated time for each task.

### Automation:
- The script automatically calculates the dates based on the start date, which defaults to today.

### Usage:
You can run this Python script on your Windows machine, and it will generate the CSV file with your entire 16-week plan, organized with a focus on one goal per week.

Feel free to modify the script as needed to tailor it to your specific career growth objectives!
