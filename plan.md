### Overall Strategy
- **Daily (Weekdays):** I will dedicate a maximum of 1 hour per day to my learning and development.
- **Weekends:** I aim to spend a maximum of 2 hours on weekends for focused study.
- **Cheat Days:** I will allow myself 1-2 cheat days per week to take a break from the plan.

### Flexible Progress Monitoring
- I will use a simple task tracker or calendar to log tasks and mark their completion.
- I plan to schedule **"reflection sessions"** every two weeks to review what’s working and where I may need to adjust my goals or pace.
- If I miss a day, I can redistribute lighter tasks in the following week to compensate.

### Cheat Days & Flexibility
- **Weekdays:** I’ll take 1 cheat day per week. 
- **Weekends:** I’ll take 1 cheat day every second weekend.
- **Flexibility:** If I feel overwhelmed, I’ll adjust my tasks accordingly, ensuring a balanced approach to learning and self-care.

This self-planning strategy balances my learning, growth, and health, allowing me to make steady progress without feeling overwhelmed. By tracking small, achievable milestones and allowing for cheat days as needed, I will stay motivated and on course.
