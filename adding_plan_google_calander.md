# Steps to Add to Google Calendar

## 1. Manual Entry (For Customization)
1. Open Google Calendar on your computer or mobile device.
2. Click the **Create** button to add an event.
3. Set the title, date, and time for each of the daily or weekly tasks.
4. You can create recurring events for tasks like:
   - Daily 1-hour learning sessions.
   - Weekend 2-hour sessions.
   - Leadership or public speaking activities (set it to recur weekly).
5. Mark "Cheat Days" by creating an all-day event titled **Cheat Day**.
6. Save and repeat for the whole plan.

## 2. Bulk Import using CSV File
To save time, you can create a CSV file with all your tasks and import them into Google Calendar.

### Create the CSV file:
1. Use Google Sheets or Excel to create a file with the following headers:
   - **Subject** (task name)
   - **Start Date** (e.g., 09/18/2024)
   - **Start Time** (e.g., 09:00 AM)
   - **End Date** (same as start date for single-day events)
   - **End Time** (e.g., 10:00 AM)
   - **Description** (optional details of the task)
   - **Location** (optional)
   - **All Day Event** (TRUE or FALSE)
   - **Private** (optional; TRUE to make it private)

You can create the events as recurring ones for daily/weekly/monthly tasks.

### Import CSV to Google Calendar:
1. Once your CSV file is ready, download it as a `.csv` file.
2. Go to Google Calendar.
3. Click on the gear icon (top right) and select **Settings**.
4. Scroll down the left-hand side, under **Import & Export**, click **Import**.
5. Select your CSV file and choose which calendar to import the events into.
6. Click **Import**.

This will automatically populate your calendar with your detailed career growth plan.
